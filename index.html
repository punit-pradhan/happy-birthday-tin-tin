                        As a daughter, you show such deep love and respect for your parents. The way you care for them,
                        look out for them, and make them proud is inspiring. You carry your family's values with grace
                        and honor, and it's one of the many reasons you are so special.

                        You're not just my sibling, but my best friend, my baby, and my everything. You are the best and
                        precious gift I have ever asked from mummy papa. Although we fight like an India Pakistan war
                        with lots of gali but still I will be the first one to kill whoever tries to upset you.
                        You were dangur but now you are the strongest person in our family. I am really proud of you.
                        This year you will be 20 and going to have a new era of your life. Wish you all the success and
                        happiness in your life.
                        Remember that satisfaction and peace of mind is very important rather than anything.
